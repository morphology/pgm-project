Future work (things we will never do but someone should really think about):
- finding a practical way to do collapsed sampling of the base
- actually using tokens to do something useful (see the litterature examples given before)

We released our implementation of the three models as open-source software (\url{https://github.com/morphology/pgm-project}).

\begin{abstract}
  Morphology studies the rules that govern the ways that the morphemes
  of a language may be put together in meaningful ways. For example,
  inflecting the word \textit{walk} to form its present participle
  form \textit{walking} indicates that the action is ongoing in the
  sentence \textit{I am walking}. In many languages, morphology can
  play an even larger role, and may encode many inflectional
  categories such as tense, aspect, mood, number, gender, or case. The
  syntax and semantics of a sentence are highly dependent on this
  information, and it is therefore crucial that natural language
  processing systems use morphological analyses.  In this work, we
  address the issue of efficiency in Bayesian nonparametric models of
  morphology. Specifically, we formulate and implement a model that
  extends the seminal work of \cite{goldwater2011}. Our new model is
  inspired by a recent reparameterization of DP mixture models that
  allows the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) to be split among
  several processors in order to speed up inference
  \cite{williamson2013}. We show how the Goldwater model can be
  reformulated as a Dirichlet process mixture model, and present new
  model of morphology for which inference can be parallelized. We show
  that our new model is as accurate as the baseline on a corpus of
  English verbs, and then use a large corpus of Russian adjectives to
  demonstrate that inference in our model is faster than serial
  inference in a model with a comparable number of variables.
